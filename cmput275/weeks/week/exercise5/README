Included files:

	> graph_concepts.cpp
	> digraph.h
	> diraph.cpp

Accessories: 
	> Just your laptop or Pc. :)

Wiring Instructions: 
	> No wires needed as this is a C++ desktop assignment

Running Instructions:
	> From the terminal type in "make" to comiple and link files. 
"Task 1": Then to run the graph_concepts program type in "./graph_concepts". This will run a program where it prints the number of connected components in a graph and then prints the number of connected components in the new graph

"Task 2": In the user input type in the CSV file you want to open using "./graph_concepts filename". After that the file name passed from the command line is read and the vertex and edges inside the files are extracted to create a undirected graph. 

"Task 3": Type in "./graph_concepts edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt". Then the program implements the behaviour of Task 2 to parse through this CSV file to extract the Vertices and Egdes information to make a graph. Then using Part 1 it counts the number of connected components inside the graph.
