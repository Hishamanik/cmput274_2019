Assignment 2: Driving Route Finder Part 1
***Consulted C++, Arduino, Adafruit GFX Documentation***
***Use of Lecture Code specified in function headers***

Included Files:
	-server.cpp (created)
	-dijkstra.cpp (created)
	-dijkstra.h
	-heap.h
	-digraph.cpp
	-digraph.h
	-wdigraph.h
	-Makefile
	-README

Running Instructions:
	1. Open the terminal and enter "make" to create executable "server"
	2. Run using "./server filename" where filename (in the same compiling directory) contains Vertices and Edges of the directed graph on each line in the following format:
		V,ID,Lat,Lon
		E,startV,endV,Name
	3. View waypoints of the shortest path between 2 coordinates using:
		"R Lat1 Lon1 Lat2 Lon2" and hitting enter
	4. Next the server will display "N #" indicating the number of waypoints; enter "A" + enter key to acknowledge. Then the server will send each waypoint one by one waiting for "A" + enter key between each sent "W lat lon", terminating the program after displating "E".

Makefile Targets:
	- make: Builds objects and executable for the program "server"
	- make clean: Remove all object files and executables

Notes and Assumptions:
	-Follows all assumptions from the assignment
