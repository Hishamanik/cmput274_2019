#Exercise 3: Word Frequency
#-----------------------------

Task 1:
> User enters a command-line argument(containg the file name which the user wants to make a frequency table of) in the terminal and if my program reads the single filename from the terminal and returns a output file with the same name and an extension 'out' added.
> The program runs perfectly and the outfile file contains exact same characters as found in the sample data file.
> My frequency table is a actual table rather than a one line table found in the sample output data file in class. This makes easy visbile for the user.

Task 2:
> The user should make sure to give a single file name one at a time as muliple command line arguments will close the program.
> This part also works perfectly and closes the python program immediately if the desired command line argument is not given.
>if desired command line argument is not given then a statement is printed to help user to input the correct command-line
