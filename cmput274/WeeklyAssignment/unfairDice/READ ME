#PART ONE:
This function generates the number of m-sided die face outcome and my function prints more number of rolls than expected. I tired to fix this but could not come up to a solution in the time frame. 



#Part TWO:
I could not finish this part properly and my function only generates a histogram for a specified number of die face rather than a m die face. 




#NOTE:I would really appreciate if the weekly exercises are released on tuesday so that we have enough time to look over the material and go to the TA if necessary. I have lots of class in Monday so cannot find the right time to go for help from the TA.This caused me having a lots of doubts which can only be solved through one to one discussion rather than emails.
