Included Files in zip.util:
- util.py: Contains program that compress and decompress files using Huffmancodes.  The compressor will be a command-line utility that encodes any file into a compressed version with a .huf extension.
-README contains instructions for the user to run the program

Modified Files:
- util.py: Contains the five functions read_tree(), decode_byte(), write_tree(), compress(), and decompress() and also the modules pickle, bitio and huffman.
_util.py: This program also contains some built-in function and some new functions have been included after importing modules for the huffman assignment.

Running the Web server to check the decompress function:
User should go to the wwwroot directory open a bash terminal and open the web server using "python3 ../webserver.py". User can then go to the url "http://localhost:8000" to view the webpage and image of Huffman that will appear.

Running compressor:
User will be able to run the compress.py script to compress files. For example, to add a new file somefile.pdf to be served by the web server,copy it to the wwwroot/directory, change to that directory, and run python3 ../compress.py some file.pdf. This will generate somefile.pdf.huf and user will be able to access the decompressed version at the URLhttp://localhost:8000/somefile.pdf.
